## Live Project
🌐 **Live Site:** https://component-garden.netlify.app/

## What is Component Garden?
**Component Garden** is a React playground (“garden”) designed to showcase my knowledge and practice of:  
- React Hooks  
- Reusable components  
- State management with **Redux** and **Zustand**  

It serves as a personal space to experiment, refine patterns, and demonstrate component design.

## Features
- **Custom reusable UI components**  
- **Global state management** with Zustand and Redux  
- Practice with **React Hooks** (useEffect, useMemo, custom hooks)  
- Scoped component styling using **CSS Modules**  
- Routing implemented with **React Router**  
- Component catalogue / playground interface for experimentation  

## Technologies Used
- **React** – Component-based UI  
- **React Router** – Client-side routing
- **Redux** – Global state management  
- **Zustand** – Global state management  
- **CSS Modules** – Component-scoped styling  

## Future Improvements
- Add more reusable components and design patterns  
- Enhance mobile responsiveness  
- Add live examples with interactive props and state
